# JobTracker
Tracks what jobs that have been applied to and current status
The Job Tracker makes use of a database to store all needed information then uses java to interact with that data. Java then passes that data to Node JS with react to have an interactable page to view the tables.

The Database is planned to be broken into two tables. One is just the list of all jobs applied to and their active status. The other is a table of all data about one job.

Data Tracked:
-job title

-next steps
-site to refernce job posting
-salary
-location/remote status
